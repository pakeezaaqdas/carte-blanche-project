# carte-blanche-project
project for freshgrad job

I used html, css, php and mySQL to do this project.
for you to see this project, you will have to have xampp from where you will start apache and mySQL
then you need to create a database named healthcare_db that consists of 2 tables
1) doctors 
   consists of the following columns: username, dr_name, email, password  
2) patients
   consists of the following columns: p_id, dr_id, patient_name, diagnosos, appointment_date, severity
   
   i wasn't able to deploy this somewhere or else time would've exceeded.
   
I am really busy these days with finals coming up, a lab final tomorrow, and all these quizzes and assignments that teachers remember to take a week before the finals so I only started this yesterday. If i were able to give it more time, I would've been able to complete the project properly but that has not been the case exactly. only 3 main functionalities were remaining i.e. edit, delete and displaying patients according to severity. and in that too i have attempted to do the edit and delete part. but there is some issue that i was unable to figure out because time had run out.

I am grateful for this opportunity that you have given me.
