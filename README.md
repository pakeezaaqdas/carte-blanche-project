# carte-blanche-project
project for freshgrad job

I used html, css, php and mySQL to do this project.
for you to see this project, you will have to have xampp from where you will start apache and mySQL
then you need to create a database named healthcare_db that consists of 2 tables
1) doctors 
   consists of the following columns: username, dr_name, email, password  
2) patients
   consists of the following columns: p_id, dr_id, patient_name, diagnosos, appointment_date, severity
   
   i wasn't able to deploy this somewhere or else time would've exceeded.
